## Advanced Challenge: Honest Abe API

Create an API using `json-server` for the resources you created above to track campaign contributions.

1. Create a `db.json` file containing all of the resources.
1. Define a few entries for each resource. Each resource must have a unique primary key.
1. Establish relationships between the resources by storing primary key values as foreign keys on related objects.
1. Run your API with the following command.
    ```sh
    json-server --watch db.json
    ```
1. Use jQuery's `$.ajax()` method to get all of the related data to build a card for each politician. It should list the bills they have sponsored, and any companies that have contributed to a PAC that has a shared interest for each bill.
